# Introduction to the Calculator App

In this project, I am building a fully responsive calculator app. The process is broken down into several lessons, each focusing on a key aspect of the appâ€™s development.

## Lesson 1: HTML Layout

As you might have guessed, I begin the project by laying out the skeleton of the calculator in HTML. At this stage, I focus on structuring the elements without worrying about the finer details.

## Lesson 2: Event Handler

Next, I set up some event handlers to detect whenever a button is pressed. This allows the calculator to respond to user input and start functioning interactively.

## Lesson 3: Removing the Zero in the Display

In this lesson, I add code to remove the zero from the top of the calculator display once I start entering numbers. This makes the calculator behave more naturally, just like a real one.

## Lesson 4: AC Button Event Handler

Here, I implement the event handler for the AC (All Clear) button. Pressing this button will clear the input area of the calculator, giving me a fresh start for new calculations.

---

## Lesson 5: Operator Button Event Handler

Now, I add event handlers for the operator buttons (such as plus, minus, multiply, and divide). This enables the calculator to handle different operations as I perform calculations.

---

## Lesson 6: Equals Button Event Handler

The calculator app is really coming together at this point. In this lesson, I add the final piece of JavaScript: the event handler for the equals button. This allows the calculator to display the result of my calculations.

## Lesson 7: Styling

With the JavaScript complete and the calculator fully functional, the last step is to add a bit of styling. This makes the app visually appealing and ensures it looks great on any device.

I hope you enjoy exploring and using my calculator app as much as I enjoyed building it!
