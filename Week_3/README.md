# 🦁 Pine City Zoo App - Week 3 (FNB App Academy)

Welcome to my Week 3 project for the **FNB App Academy**. This week, I built a fictional tour guide app called **Pine City Zoo** using HTML and CSS.

By now, I’ve already explored the fundamentals of app development and created my first basic app. This project helped me apply what I’ve learned in a more real-world scenario by following guided lessons and building out a structured app.

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to structure and plan a real-world app
- The basics of the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**
- Creating reusable components with HTML and CSS
- Introduction to **UI (User Interface)** and **UX (User Experience)** design
- How to organize a development environment and manage assets

## 🛠️ Lessons I Completed

### 📁 Lesson 1: Setting Up the Environment
I created a folder named `Pine City Zoo`, and inside it, added an `images` folder for all the assets I’d be using.

### 🏠 Lesson 2: Building the Home Page

I coded the app's homepage using simple HTML elements. It includes:
- A zoo logo
- A top navigation bar with links to Animals, Map, and Places
- A central map image
- A bottom tab bar with Weather and Feedback options

### 🎨 Lessons 3–6: Styling the Home Page with CSS

I styled the:
- Header

This improved the layout and gave it a more polished look.

I built an Animals page with linked sections for different zoo animals. I started with the Elephant section and added others later. I also:
- Created `info-box` links
- Used thumbnails and short descriptions
- Styled everything for consistency and responsiveness
