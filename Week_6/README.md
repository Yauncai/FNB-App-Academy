# 📒 Contact Book App – Week 6

Welcome to my Week 6 project! This week, I’m building a Contact Book app, learning how to interact with APIs, handle data, and create a more dynamic user experience. Here’s a summary of my journey and what I’ve accomplished.

---

## 📝 Lesson 1: Introduction to the App

This week’s focus is on developing a Contact Book app. I started by understanding the app’s purpose and the features I’ll be implementing.

## 🌐 Lesson 2: Introduction to the API

I was introduced to the concept of APIs and how they allow my app to communicate with external services to fetch and manage contact data.

---

## 🛠️ Lesson 3: Setting Up

I set up my development environment and prepared the basic structure for the Contact Book app.

---

## 🔑 Lesson 4: The API Key

I learnt about API keys and how they are used for authentication. If my email address didn’t work as an API key, I could use:  
`appacademy@itvarsity.org`

---

## 📥 Lesson 5: Getting the Contact

I practised fetching a single contact from the API, which is the foundation for displaying and managing contact information.

---

## 👁️ Lesson 6: Displaying the Contact

I displayed the fetched contact details on the app interface, making the data visible and user-friendly.

---

## 🔄 Lesson 7: Iterating through a JSON Array

I learnt how to loop through a JSON array of contacts, allowing me to display multiple contacts efficiently.

---

## 🔃 Lesson 8: Refresh Button

I added a refresh button so users can update the contact list without reloading the entire page.

---

## ➕ Lesson 9: Add Contact Form

I created a form that lets users add new contacts to the Contact Book.

---

## 🗂️ Lesson 10: Creating the FormData Object

I learnt how to use the FormData object to collect and prepare form data for submission.

---

## 📤 Lesson 11: Submitting the FormData Object

I implemented functionality to submit the FormData object to the API, adding new contacts to the database.

---

## 🏠 Lesson 12: Adding the Home Link Function

I added a home link function to improve navigation within the app.

---

## ✏️ Lesson 13: Edit Contact Page Introduction

I began work on the Edit Contact page, which allows users to update existing contact details.

---

## 🏗️ Lesson 14: Building the Edit Contact Page

I built the structure for the Edit Contact page, setting up the necessary HTML and logic.

---

## 🔗 Lesson 15: Linking to the Edit Contact Page

I made sure users can easily navigate to the Edit Contact page from the main contact list.

---

## 📝 Lesson 16: Edit Contact Form

I created a form for editing contact details, making it easy to update information.

I prepared the FormData object with the updated information before submitting it to the API.

---

## 🚀 Lesson 22: Submitting the Form – Calling Fetch

Finally, I submitted the updated contact information using the Fetch API, completing the edit functionality.

---

## 🎉 Conclusion

This week, I’ve deepened my understanding of APIs, form handling, and dynamic web app development. The Contact Book app now supports adding, viewing, editing, and refreshing contacts, making it a practical and interactive project. I’m excited to keep building on these skills!
